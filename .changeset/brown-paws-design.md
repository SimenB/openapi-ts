feat: Symbol API

### Symbol API

This release adds the Symbol API, which significantly reduces the risk of naming collisions. While the generated output should only include formatting changes, this feature introduces breaking changes to the Plugin API that affect custom plugins.

We will update the [custom plugin guide](https://heyapi.dev/openapi-ts/plugins/custom) once the Plugin API becomes more stable.
